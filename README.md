# Project abandoned â€” February 8, 2016

Twitch no longer seems to provide its HLS streams to the public. `http://twitch.tv/{channelname}/hls` is no longer working. HLS never left beta status, so I'm not too surprised to see it go.

Twitch no longer requires Flash to view streams on their official site. The new HTML5 streamer still requires more resources than Spasm did, but the difference isn't big enough for me to motivate me to recreate Spasm.

There are certainly ways for even a 3rd party like myself to create a better Twitch experience. For example, I believe [Livestreamer](http://docs.livestreamer.io/cli.html) is still capable of providing the direct URI in multiple streaming formats for any Twitch stream. So, it is still possible to make a native, cross-platform Twitch desktop application with some really neat features.

I have other priorities, unfortunately. For now, thank you all for having used my software! :)
